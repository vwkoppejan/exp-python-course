The objective of this lab is to create your first data product.

### Assignment:
- Split  into teams of 3-4 people
- Start by creating a team git repository to which your team will contribute.
- Create a project structure. You can either come up with a structure yourself or save some time and use a `cookiecutter` template.
    
    - First install a [Cookiecutter Python package](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html)
    ```bash
   $ pip install cookiecutter
    ```
    - Either look around on github for a project template you like (search for cookiecutter-data-science or cookiecutter-machine-learning) or use one of the two provided templates.
  
  More comprehensive template:
  ```bash
  $ cookiecutter https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science
  ```
  A slimmer version from a GDD colleague:
  ```bash
  $ cookiecutter https://github.com/hgrif/cookiecutter-ds-python
  ```
  Keep in mind that when using a cookiecutter you don't need to create a folder in advance, just follow the prompts in the commad line!
- Start working out the excercises in the "Model building lab.ipynb". When you're done with the lab you will have all components to put into your python package.
